This document outlines the step-by-step logical flow of the src/monitoring.py script. The script is designed to simulate a real-time monitoring agent by processing log entries and enriching them with critical operational metadata.
The process for each interaction is as follows:
Ingestion: The script reads the sample_chatbot_logs.jsonl file from the project's root directory, processing one interaction (one line) at a time.
Error & PII Analysis: For each interaction, two primary checks are performed:
Functional Error Check: It validates the data, flagging critical issues like a null bot response.
PII Detection: It scans the bot_response text for common Personally Identifiable Information (PII) patterns, specifically emails and phone numbers, using regular expressions.
Latency Simulation: To mimic the real-world performance of an LLM API call, the script intentionally pauses for a random duration (between 300ms and 1.8s). It measures the time taken for this simulated operation to calculate a realistic latency value in milliseconds.
Enrichment and Structuring: The script combines the original interaction data with the results of the checks (the error status, the PII flag, and the calculated latency) into a single, structured Python dictionary.
Output Stream: The final, enriched dictionary is converted into a JSON string and printed to standard output (the console). This process is repeated for every interaction in the input file, creating a stream of structured JSON logs
