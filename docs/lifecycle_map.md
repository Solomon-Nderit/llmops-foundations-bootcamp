Chatbot LLMOps Lifecycle
This document outlines the end-to-end operational lifecycle for our customer-facing chatbot. The model follows a continuous, iterative loop designed to ensure the application is robust, safe, and constantly improving based on both automated monitoring and human feedback.

Lifecycle Phases Explained
Each phase in the diagram represents a critical function in maintaining and enhancing our chatbot.
1. Develop
Engineers build and test new features, update prompts, or implement fixes based on the "Improve" phase. This is where all code changes are made in feature branches before being merged into the main branch.
2. Deploy
A new, tested version of the chatbot application is released to production. This process is managed through our Git workflow, where the main branch is merged into the stable branch, which represents the live version.
3. Monitor
This is the automated, real-time observation of the live chatbot. Our monitoring.py script runs continuously, watching every conversation for three key risks: high latency (slow responses), PII leaks (privacy violations), and functional errors (e.g., null responses).
4. Evaluate
When the monitoring system flags an issue (e.g., a sudden spike in errors), the engineering and product teams analyze the logs to diagnose the root cause. This phase is about understanding the "why" behind a problem.
5. Collect Feedback
We gather qualitative data that automated monitoring cannot capture. Users and internal teams can submit bug reports, suggestions, or examples of confusing responses through our feedback collector, providing critical real-world context.
6. Improve
Using insights from both the "Evaluate" and "Collect Feedback" phases, the team prioritizes what to fix or enhance. This plan directly informs the next "Develop" phase, closing the loop and ensuring the chatbot gets progressively better.
